      "📝 Description: AML Uncovered is an intermediate level program designed to bridge foundational AML concepts with practical, real world application. Through six focused modules, participants deepen their understanding of money laundering typologies, regulatory frameworks, and risk based approaches used by financial institutions. The course emphasizes KYC and EDD practices, ongoing due diligence, transaction monitoring, and alert management, equipping staff with the skills to detect, investigate, and report suspicious activities. Learners will analyze typologies across sectors, assess governance structures, and implement scalable controls aligned with risk tiers. Real world case studies Nuvafin Securities, Ocean Trust Europe, PayPal Asia, and Capstone Exchange illustrate common control gaps and remediation strategies. Each module combines short, practical videos with targeted readings to reinforce concepts, complemented by quizzes that test understanding and a final exam that synthesizes learning. The program is valuable for compliance professionals, financial analysts, and risk managers seeking to strengthen AML/CFT programs, build KYC excellence, and enhance risk governance. By the end of AML Uncovered, participants will be able to apply a risk based approach to AML/CFT program design, perform enhanced due diligence in high risk scenarios, and contribute to robust reporting and governance frameworks.\n",
